<!-- CSS Selectors
CSS selectors are used to "find" (or select) the HTML elements you want to style.

We can divide CSS selectors into five categories:

1. Simple selectors (select elements based on name, id, class)
2. Combinator selectors (select elements based on a specific relationship between them)
3. Pseudo-class selectors (select elements based on a certain state)
4. Pseudo-elements selectors (select and style a part of an element)
5. Attribute selectors (select elements based on an attribute or attribute value) -->

<!-- CSS Combinators
    1. descendant selector (space)
    2. child selector (>)
    3. adjacent sibling selector (+)
    4. general sibling selector (~) -->
